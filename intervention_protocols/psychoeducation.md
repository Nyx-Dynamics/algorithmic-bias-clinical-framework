## What Are Algorithms and How Do They Affect You?

When you apply for a job, an apartment, a loan, or even medical care, a computer program often makes decisions about you before any human sees your application. These programs are called **algorithms**.

Algorithms look at information about your past—your credit history, employment history, criminal records, medical records, and more—and use this information to predict whether you'll be a "good" employee, tenant, or borrower.

**The problem:** These algorithms often make mistakes, and even when they don't, they can trap people in cycles of rejection that have nothing to do with who you are today.

## How the "Algorithm Trap" Works

Imagine this scenario:

1. **Something bad happens** (you lose a job, get evicted, have a medical emergency)
2. **The event gets recorded** in databases (credit bureaus, background check companies)
3. **Algorithms see this record** and lower your "score"
4. **You get rejected** for jobs, housing, or credit
5. **The rejection creates new problems** (longer unemployment gap, more financial stress)
6. **These new problems get recorded** → Your score drops further
7. **Cycle repeats**

This is called a **feedback loop**. Each rejection makes the next rejection more likely.

### The Math Is Real

Research shows:
- Starting score after a setback: 365 (borderline)
- After 5 rejections: 215 (declining)
- After 10 rejections: 15 (very difficult to recover)

**Only 3 in 10,000 people** successfully fix all their records across all systems.

## Why It's Not Your Fault

You might feel like you keep failing, or that something is wrong with you. But consider this:

- The system has a **0.03% success rate** for people trying to correct their records
- Individual effort has **almost no effect** on algorithmic outcomes
- The **same application** can be rejected by algorithm and accepted by human reviewer
- Your perception that "the system is against you" may be **accurate, not distorted**

**This is a system problem, not a personal failure.**

## What You Can Do

### If It's Been Less Than 6 Months Since Your Setback

This is your **best window** for intervention. Actions to take:

1. **Get your records now**
   - Free credit reports: annualcreditreport.com
   - Background check: Ask the company that rejected you for details

2. **Document everything**
   - Keep copies of rejection letters
   - Note dates of applications and responses

3. **Dispute errors immediately**
   - File disputes online with credit bureaus
   - Send certified letters for background check errors

4. **Ask your therapist/case manager for help**
   - Clinical letters can sometimes help
   - They may know advocacy resources

### If It's Been More Than 6 Months

The window for prevention has narrowed, but you can still:

1. **Focus on what you CAN control**
   - Building positive data (on-time payments, stable address)
   - Seeking employers/landlords who do human review

2. **Protect your mental health**
   - This situation is not your fault
   - It's okay to grieve the unfairness
   - Focus energy on paths that don't require algorithmic approval

3. **Consider legal options**
   - Legal aid organizations may help with FCRA violations
   - Some errors may be legally actionable

## What Your Therapist/Case Manager Can Do

Your mental health provider can:

- **Write clinical letters** explaining circumstances to employers/landlords
- **Document disability** if algorithmic harm is affecting your functioning
- **Help you process** the grief, shame, and anger that comes with systemic exclusion
- **Refer you** to legal advocates who specialize in consumer rights
- **Support realistic goal-setting** that works around system barriers

---

## What This Is NOT

This is NOT:
- **An excuse** to stop trying
- **Permission** to give up
- **A reason** to avoid all applications

This IS:
- **An explanation** for why things have been so hard
- **Validation** that your perception of unfairness is accurate
- **Information** to help you choose your battles wisely
- **Permission** to stop blaming yourself

---

## Feelings You Might Have (All Are Normal)

- **Anger** at a system designed to exclude people
- **Grief** for opportunities lost
- **Shame** about your history (even though it's not your fault)
- **Hopelessness** about ever getting ahead
- **Relief** at finally understanding why
- **Determination** to work around the system

All of these are valid responses to an unjust situation.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Algorithmic rejection is not personal failure**
2. **The system has a 0.03% success rate** - it's designed to be nearly impossible
3. **Earlier intervention works better** - if you can act within 6 months, do it
4. **Your perception of unfairness is accurate** - this is not paranoia
5. **You deserve support** - ask your treatment team for help
