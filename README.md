# Algorithmic Harm: A Clinical Framework for Mental Health Professionals

**Understanding and Treating the Psychological Impact of Algorithmic Discrimination**

*For Therapists, Social Workers, Addiction Counselors, and Case Managers*

---

## Why This Matters for Your Practice

Your clients are experiencing a new form of systematic harm that looks like personal failure but is actually systemic design. When a client says "I keep getting rejected and I don't know why," they may be caught in an **algorithmic feedback loop**—a mathematically inevitable spiral that:

- Creates learned helplessness indistinguishable from depression
- Triggers shame responses that compound existing trauma
- Generates real-world consequences that validate negative self-beliefs
- Resists individual-level intervention because the system is designed to fail

**This is not their fault. The math proves it.**

## The Clinical Problem

### What Your Clients Experience

| Client Report | Clinical Presentation | Actual Mechanism |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------|
| "I'm unemployable" | Learned helplessness, depression | Algorithmic score below hiring threshold |
| "Nobody will rent to me" | Shame, housing instability | Tenant screening algorithm rejection |
| "I can't get approved for anything" | Hopelessness, anxiety | Credit algorithm feedback loop |
| "The system is rigged against me" | Possible paranoid ideation? | **Actually accurate perception** |
| "Why bother trying?" | Motivational deficit, depression | Rational response to 0.03% success rate |

### The Diagnostic Challenge

Algorithmic harm presents as:
- **Major Depressive Disorder** (hopelessness, worthlessness, anhedonia)
- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder** (worry about applications, hypervigilance)
- **Adjustment Disorder** (following job loss, housing denial)
- **Complex PTSD** (in clients with repeated systemic trauma)
- **Substance Use Disorder** (self-medication of algorithmic shame)

**Critical insight:** These are valid diagnoses AND the client is experiencing real external harm. Both are true. Treatment must address both.

### Mathematical Reality Your Clients Face

- **Initial score after adverse event:** 365 (borderline)
- **After 5 rejections:** 215 (declining)
- **After 10 rejections:** 15 (permanent failure state)
- **Success rate navigating remediation:** 0.03%
- **Time window for effective intervention:** 6 months

**Clinical implication:** Your client's sense of hopelessness may be an accurate assessment of their situation under current system design.

## Key Clinical Concepts

### 1. Algorithmic Shame vs. Authentic Shame

| Feature | Authentic Shame | Algorithmic Shame |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Source | Violation of personal values | System rejection message |
| Function | Promotes behavioral change | Promotes learned helplessness |
| Accuracy | Reflects actual wrongdoing | Reflects system bias/design |
| Resolution | Repair, amends, growth | Cannot be resolved individually |
| Treatment | Process emotion, make amends | Externalize, advocate, protect |

**Clinical guidance:** Help clients distinguish between shame they need to process (authentic) and shame that has been weaponized against them (algorithmic).

### 2. Learned Helplessness vs. Accurate Helplessness

Traditional learned helplessness model assumes the perception of uncontrollability is **distorted**. In algorithmic harm:

- The system **actually** has a 0.03% success rate
- Individual effort **actually** has minimal effect on outcomes
- The perception of helplessness **is accurate**

**Clinical implication:** Don't gaslight clients by insisting they can overcome systemic barriers through positive thinking. Validate the reality while building targeted agency.

### 3. The 6-Month Critical Window

Intervention efficacy by timing:
- **0-3 months:** >85% efficacy (optimal intervention period)
- **3-6 months:** 60-85% efficacy (urgent intervention needed)
- **6-12 months:** 30-60% efficacy (limited options)
- **12+ months:** <30% efficacy (focus on harm reduction)

**Clinical implication:** Screening for recent adverse events allows early intervention when it can still help.

## Populations at Elevated Risk

### Clients in Your Practice Most Affected

| Population | Algorithmic Exposure Risk | PAF* |
|------------|---------------------------|------|
| Clients with SUD history | Very High | 65.2% |
| Clients with HIV | High | 49.5% |
| Justice-involved clients | Very High | 73.6% |
| Clients with housing instability | High | 59.3% |
| Clients with employment gaps | Moderate-High | 40-50% |
| Clients with medical debt | Moderate | 35-40% |

*PAF = Population Attributable Fraction (% of adverse outcomes due to algorithms)

### Intersection with Existing Vulnerabilities

Algorithmic harm compounds existing clinical presentations:

- **SUD + Algorithmic harm:** Recovery undermined by employment/housing barriers
- **PTSD + Algorithmic harm:** Re-traumatization through repeated rejection
- **Depression + Algorithmic harm:** Hopelessness validated by real outcomes
- **Anxiety + Algorithmic harm:** Hypervigilance about applications becomes adaptive

## Quick Reference: When to Suspect Algorithmic Harm

**Screen for algorithmic harm when client reports:**

- [ ] Recent job loss, termination, or resignation
- [ ] Multiple unexplained rejections (jobs, housing, credit)
- [ ] "I don't understand why I keep getting rejected"
- [ ] Sense that "the system is against me"
- [ ] Background check or credit check concerns
- [ ] History in criminal justice system
- [ ] Medical debt or bankruptcy
- [ ] Gap in employment history
- [ ] Recent eviction or housing instability
- [ ] Denial of services without clear explanation

**If 3+ items endorsed:** Administer full Algorithmic Harm Screening Scale (AHSS)

## Ethical Considerations

### Duty to Inform

Clients have a right to understand that:
1. Their struggles may have systemic, not personal, causes
2. The system has a documented 0.03% success rate
3. Early intervention is more effective than later intervention
4. Advocacy and legal remedies exist (even if limited)

### Avoiding Iatrogenic Harm

Traditional therapeutic approaches can cause harm if they:
- Attribute systemic barriers to personal deficits
- Encourage "positive thinking" about rigged systems
- Focus exclusively on internal change when external advocacy is needed
- Pathologize accurate perceptions of discrimination

### Scope of Practice

Mental health professionals can:
- Screen for and assess algorithmic harm
- Provide psychoeducation about systemic factors
- Write clinical letters supporting clients
- Refer to legal advocates when appropriate
- Document harm for disability/accommodation purposes

Mental health professionals should NOT:
- Provide legal advice
- Guarantee outcomes of advocacy efforts
- Minimize real systemic barriers
- Treat algorithmic harm as purely psychological
